# All the components are in the same single file App.jsx

# it will work. But, it is not recommended to keep all in same file.

# If two components are super closely related and really work with each other, then use both of them

# in a single file.

# Create a components folder under src folder and create convenient component function code as in respective Component file.

# Name the Component file as the same name as Component name
